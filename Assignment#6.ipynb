    "Question: Define Object Oriented Programming Language?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of OBJECT, which can contain data, in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures. A feature of objects is an object's procedures that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: List down the Benefits of OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "*OOP provides a clear modular structure for programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "*It is good for defining abstract data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Implementation details are hidden from other modules and other modules has a clearly defined interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "*It is easy to maintain and modify existing code as new objects can be created with small differences to existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Objects, methods, instance, message passing, inheritance are some important properties provided by these particular languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction are also counts in these fundamentals of programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "*It implements real life scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "*In OOP, programmer not only defines data types but also deals with operations applied for data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: Differentiate between function and method?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a piece of code that is called by name. It can be passed data to operate on (i.e. the parameters) and can optionally return data (the return value). All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A method is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object. In most respects it is identical to a function except for two key differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "*A method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called.\n",
    "\n",
    "*A method is able to operate on data that is contained within the class (remembering that an object is an instance of a class - the class is the definition, the object is an instance of that data).\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: Define the following terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Class: A class is a code template for creating objects. Objects have member variables and have behaviour associated with them. Class is created by the keyword class. An object is created using the constructor of the class. This object will then be called the instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object: Object is simply a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions) that act on those data. And, class is a blueprint for the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attribute: An attribute is a specification that defines a property of an object, element, or file. It may also refer to or set the specific value for a given instance of such. For clarity, attributes should more correctly be considered metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavior: The behavior of an object is defined by its methods, which are the functions and subroutines defined within the object class. Methods determine what type of functionality a class has, how it modifies its data, and its overall behavior."
